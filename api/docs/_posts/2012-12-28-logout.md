This method logs out a user.

### Request

* The headers must include a **valid access token**.
```Authorization: Bearer TOKEN```

### Response

```{
  "success": true
}```

### Implementation Notes

* The access_token will become invalidated, and should no longer be kept on the client.

For errors responses, see the [response status codes documentation](#response-status-codes).
