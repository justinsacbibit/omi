### Request

* **The body can't be empty** and must include:
  * client_id, issued by the server administrator.
  * client_secret, issued by the server administrator.
  * fb_access_token, obtained from a user logging in to Facebook

```{
  "client_id": bestapp,
  "client_secret": fj9a8sjefansdfkjasdfasd,
  "fb_access_token": "sdfkljsdfja39nassf9asdf"
}```

### Response

Sends back a token and user data.

```{
  "token": {
    "access_token": "5ZLwlwz94d9w03323z3oItxCGonmdHoETtIrjtaOv70=",
    "expires": "5184000"
  },
  "user": {
    "facebook_id": 3871019282387,
    "name": "Justin Sacbibit"
  }

### Implementation Notes

* The fb_access_token should be discarded, while the access_token should be saved.
* The access_token is required for most API calls.
